# Wind-Turbines-Case-Study
In this project, we analyze wind energy data from the city of Paris. We explore variables such as wind speed and direction, aiming to understand their impact on energy generation. Through data visualizations, we provide insights into the potential of wind power in urban environments and its role in sustainable energy solutions.
